# TODO
Simple Task Manager Web App 

A simple multi-user task manager web app, that allows you to keep track of your todo list, with status, expiry dates, tags, descriptions, etc.
It has a simple UI because its a training project for an internship. Its not supposed to look beautiful its just for me to get the hang of it. Plus my focus is more on the backend.
There are some UI improvements to be made, but again, the focus is not that, it's the funtionality that works (supposedly).

Small chance querys have different column names as the actual ones on the sql file to create db.
